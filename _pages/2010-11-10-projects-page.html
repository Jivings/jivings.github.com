The following are a sub-set of the projects that I completed during my time at University.

I am also working on several of my own personal projects, which shall be made available here when completed!
<h2><strong>Java Projects</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>April 2009 - HTCPCP <a title="Download" href="ftp://guest@95.172.245.87/projects/coffee/ " target="_self">Client and Server</a> (Password available on request).</li>
</ul>
The design and development of an <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2324.html" target="_blank">RFC2324</a> compliant Coffee Pot Server.

A project that sought to develop understanding of HTTP and other relevant protocols in order to derive functionality of a HTTP-based fictional protocol; Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP).

The Java aspect of the project incorporated extensive use of threading and socket control, and achieved

<h2><em>Web Development</em></h2>

<ul>
	<li>June 2011 - <a href="/projects/websites/the-news-lies/">'The News Lies'</a></li>
</ul>
A news submission site aimed at uncovering lies and misrepresentations in the world media. Written to a client specification, the project incorporates heavy user interaction including a full voting system, user submitted content and comprehensive indexed searching. 

<ul>
	<li>November 2009 - <a href="/projects/websites/twintowns/">'Twin Towns' Website</a></li>
</ul>
A group web design project to build awareness of the 'Twinning Movement'. The project, based heavily on XML, involves detailed data collection from multiple sources regarding British towns and their continental equivalent twin towns.

Data has the option of being generated on the fly and includes Google maps, Yahoo weather, RSS news feeds and Youtube videos.

<ul>
	<li>December 2008 - Webair Website</li>
</ul>
A first year web design group project to create a website for a fictional small British airline company. Featuring a complete booking system, a customer login function allowing detailed overview of bookings, and an admin mechanism for flight and timetable maintenance.

The project was designed to build on knowledge of website and database integration using PHP/Perl and MySQL, as well as how to provide an effective user interface.

<h2>Other Scripts and Programs</h2>
<ul>
	<li>November 2008 - <a href="../projects/asm/asm.zip" target="_self">File Transfer Program</a> written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language" target="_blank">X86 Assembly Language</a><strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>
A first year project designed to increase understanding of compilers and low level language.  During this project we were expected to make extensive use of the Visual Studio debugger in order to derive machine code from high-level language, and alongside our own research, produce a program written entirely in assembly code that is capable of transferring a text file between two computers connected via a Serial port.

<strong>More to come!</strong>
