A new dawn, Â a new day and another new webhost!

I've been busy the last few days setting up a new site. I am now running off a brand spanking new Ubuntu 9.10 VPS, courtesy of my friends at <a title="xilo.net" href="http://xilo.net" target="_blank">Xilo</a>, who have made the transition very simple.

As you may notice, I am also now using Wordpress (who isn't?), which was fairly straightforward to install on Ubuntu, despite not having any experience with the CMS.

For those who wonder, I'm using a Wordpress theme by <a title="SmashingMagazine" href="http://smashingmagazine.com/" target="_blank">SmashingMagazine</a> and <a href="http://slimmity.com/" target="_blank">Slimmity</a> called SimpleFolio. After some slight CSS changes the result is before you, which saves me a considerable amount of time creating my own!

Another new experience for me was creating and editing a mysql database in Linux, but it did not prove too difficult, and the Wordpress tables almost took care of themselves.

Time to stop experimenting with the blogging features and get moving my content over from my old (and now dated) website!
