I just discovered this old piece of code while digging through ancient e-mails. which I was quite pleased about since I thought it had been lost.

I wrote it to perform the simple function of getting text from an open window in XP, though I assume it would work for other Windows versions.
I had been writing a Java program which required text from the output of a native Windows application. And although this could probably better be achieved in a different language, I thought that integrating Python output into a Java application would be fairly trivial. 

I achieved it by simply using <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html">Runtime</a> and <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Process.html">Process</a> objects.

<pre lang="java" line="1">
final String pythonDir = "cmd /c pythonFile.py";
final Runtime r  = Runtime.getRuntime();

//run python process
try
{
   Process p = r.exec(pythonDir);
   BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(p.getInputStream()), 5000);

   //while there is text, read.
   while ((line = br.readLine()) != null)
   {
     //parse each line
   }
}
catch (Exception e)
{ }
// done
</pre>


However, from what I remember it was the Python that proved exceptionally difficult, mainly due to terrible documentation, and from some Googling I can see I'm not the only one to have found this <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-win32/2004-December/002771.html">problem</a>. Now at least it does seem to have gotten <a href="http://www.pha.com.au/kb/index.php/Python_-_ctypes#GUI_Examples">better</a>, though probably it's easier to find now that I know what to search for.

Nevertheless, I managed to hack together workable code to find a specific open window based on the Title bar text, and grab text from that window.
Though it is probably not the most elegant or fastest solution, it worked and I was able to read the window text output into my Java application perfectly.

I can't remember enough to document my code line by line, but I think from the comments it should be quite straightforward...

And there we are, I hope this is able to save someone else all the time that it cost me.
