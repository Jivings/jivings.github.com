I recently wrote a report for University on mobile development. The question I posed was; 
<code>"Will mobile application development continue to be lucrative in a market with increasing emphasis on cloud and web based services?".</code>

I have been working a great deal with mobile technologies and I feel I have gained some insight into the direction is which the industry is heading. 
If you have time, give my article a read. It is essentially a web-app and can be found at the link below, where it can also be downloaded as an Android application.

<a href="http://www.ivings.org.uk/projects/mobile/">http://www.ivings.org.uk/projects/mobile/</a>

The site uses jQuery Mobile to render the pages. This is an amazing tool, though still in Beta. I converted it into an Android Application using PhoneGap. Information about both these technologies can be found within the report.
