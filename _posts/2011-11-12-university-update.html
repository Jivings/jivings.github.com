Not many posts recently! I've been concentrating on my final year University project for the past few months and it's finally taking shape. 

The project itself is based on JavaScript and I've decided that I will share several problems I've encountered and my own thoughts on the language over the next few months. When my project is finally complete I will be releasing it under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons" title="CC">Creative Commons</a> license for others to explore.

It's very exciting (at least for me!) so stay tuned for updates! Time to get back to work...
